        <p>This is what I would look like as an Inkling from the video game, <em>Splatoon</em>!
          If you're not familiar with <em>Splatoon</em>, it's a 2015 online multiplayer
          third-person shooter game made by Nintendo! It's also one of my favorite games!  Let me tell you about it!</p>

        <p>Like I said, <em>Splatoon</em> is a video game that was released in 2015 by Nintendo.
          It's a third-person shooter game where you play as these cute little creatures called "Inklings".
          They have two distinct forms.  There first form is their human or "kid" form, which lets them use weapons!
          There are many different types of weapons in the game, all of which are used to spread ink on the floor and walls!</p>
          <h1>Shooters shoot ink!</h1>

          <h1>Rollers are rolled along the ground leaving a trail of ink behind you!</h1>

          <h1>Chargers can be charged to increase their range and damage, and shoot in a long, straight line!</h1>

          <h1>Sloshers are like buckets that let you hurl ink over walls!</h1>

          <h1>Splatlings can be revved up like Gatling guns to unleash a rapid
          burst of shots!</h1>

          <p>Their second form is their squid form!  In this form they can swim through ink, even on walls, and pass through
            grates!</p>

          <p>But they can't swim in ink that's not their color, and if they fall in water, they die!</p>

          <p>The goal of the game is to cover the ground with your team's ink, and stop the enemy team from doing
            the same!  If more of your team's color is on the ground by the end, you win!
            And when you win, you earn money which you can use to buy new weapons and unlock cool gear for your Inkling!
             And that's not all!  There's super jumping, a single-player mode, awesome music, talking cats, and
             a whole lot more!  So what are you waiting for?  If you have a Wii U, I'd totally recommend
             getting a copy of Splatoon!  Go ink the world and have fun!</p>
